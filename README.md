# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Is a way of designing,developingand maintaining software programs 

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
software engineering is the process of developing softwares including planning,designing,building,testing,maintaining systems 
traditional programming is where you write a code to solve a particular problem without following a structured approach 
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
it entails planning,designing,implementation,testing and maintaining the software 

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
planning-defining project goals,scope and resource requirements.
designing-involves defining system components,data models,algorithms and user interface.
implementation-deisgners write code according to design specifications.
testing-verify if the software meets the required specifications.
maintaining-this is where the software is monitored and updated to changing requirements.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Waterfall model-is a step by step where each stage must be finalised first before starting the other stage
agile model-it is more focused on being flexible and customer satisfaction 
differences:waterfall is sequential while agile is adaptable and flexible to change
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
this is where defining,documenting and maintaining requirements in the engineering process 
it's important because helps software engineers better work on the problem.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
modularity in software design is separating a system into different modules
It makes your software more organised and maintained 
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
unit testing is whereby the w system is tested in units
integration testing this is where component of the Software is gradually integrated and tested as un unified group 
system testing this is testing where one checks if all components of an application integrate together 
acceptance testing is testing whether the software is accepted by the end user

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
version control system are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.
examples centralised and distributed 
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
software project manager are responsible for every aspect of the project including leading the team 
challenges risk management,accountability, team conflict 
responsibility planning,leading the team.
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
software maintenance process of changing,modifying and updating software to keep up with user needs.
types of maintenance 
corrective-necessary when something goes wrong I. the software 
adaptive-deals with changing technologies regarding the software 
preventive-entails looking at the future to ensure your software is working as deired
perfective-adjusting the software by adding new features to satisfy user needs
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
privacy,accuracy,accessibility how can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work
training and education 
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
